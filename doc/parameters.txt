** Detailed description

-b, --brightness shape,scale [default: as runfile]
	Set parameters for the distribution of cluster brightness. The cluster
brightness represents the combination of the incident intensity of the laser on
the each cluster and the number of fluropores emitting (roughly the size of the
cluster). The distribution of brightness is modelled as a Weibull distribution
with given shape and scale, real valued numbers greater than zero, with mean and
variance:
	Mean:      scale \Gamma( 1 + 1/shape)
	Variance:  scale^2 \Gamma( 1 + 2/shape ) - mean^2
where \Gamma is the Gamma function.


-c, --cycles ncycle [default: as runfile]
	Number of cycles to generate likelihoods for, up to maximum allowed in
the runfile. If more cycles are asked for than allowed, a warning is printed and
the number of cycles outputted is restricted to number specificed in the 
runfile.


-l, --lane lane [default: as runfile]
	Set lane number in the output to "lane". Lane number must be greater
than zero but need not be a number valid for a real machine.


-p, --paired
	Treat run as paired-end. For single-ended runs treated as paired, the 
covariance matrix is duplicated to make two uncorrelated pairs with identical
error characteristics. For paired-end runs treated as single, the second end is
ignored. The covariance matrices for the ends of a paired-end run were estimated
and stored separately, implying an assumption of independence between the two
ends. The brightness of the cluster is assumed to be equal for both ends, which 
can be changed using the "--unequal" option.


-r, --robust mu [default: 0.]
	Output robustified likelihood, equivalent to adding mu to the likelihood
of every call. "mu" should be a real number greater than zero. The default for 
simNGS is to produce raw likelihoods so errors outside the scope of the base 
calling can be modelled elsewhere; the default for the AYB base calling software
uses a value of 1e-5 to compensate for unmodelled effects like "dust" on the 
slide or sample preparation errors.

The consequences of adding a "mu" is to bound the maximum possible likelihood-
ratio statistic, and so the quality of the call, and to pull extremely small 
likelihoods where the statistical model does fit the observation for any 
possible base call back towards equi-probable. The theory behind this is 
consider the observation to be a mixture of the model and small proportion of
contaminant, then define the robustified likelihood to be the supremum over all
possible contaminants (i.e. allow the contaminant to be the worst possible).


-s, --seed seed [default: clock]
	Seed used to set random number generator. Where no seed is given, it is
initialised from the clock of the machine and written to stderr. Care should be 
taken if multiple jobs are started simultaneously, on a farm with synchronised 
clocks for example, and an explicit seed is not set.


-t, --tile tile [default: as runfile]
	Set tile number in the output to "tile". Tile number must be greater
than zero but need not be a number valid for a real machine.

-u, --unequal
	Cluster brightness for pair-end data is not considered to be equal for
both ends. The brightness of each end is sampled independently.


-v, --variance factor [default: 1.0]
	Factor with which to scale variance matrix by and so increase or
decrease the amount of background noise generated. Multiplying the variance
by a factor f is mathematically equivalent to multiplying the scale of the
brightness distribution by 1/sqrt(f).
